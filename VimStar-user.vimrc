" VimStar User Config
"
" VimStar defaults to a word processor configuration, with
" leader mappings inspired by WordStar. This file is sourced
" last, so it's an ideal place to put default settings that
" users might want to change.
"
" If you mess something up, A copy of this file sits in the
" .VimStar folder, ready to be copied to your root, so you
" can reset everything to the defaults.
