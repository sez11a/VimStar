# Welcome to VimStar! 

This is a NeoVim distribution optimized for *writing*. Key shortcuts (using Space instead of CTRL) are a homage to WordStar. 

## Quick Guide: 

1.  Press Space in normal mode to see the menu. 

2.  There are WordStar-like key bindings with helpful menus. Instead, however, of the Ctrl key, they're prefixed with Space instead, to avoid collision with Vim keys (such as Ctrl-o). See Space-k, Space-o, Space-q, and Space-g. 

3.  Plugins are downloaded automatically via Lazy, and should be downloaded automatically after installing. 

4.  Configuration is symlinked, so you can try VimStar and then easily go back to your own configuration (have a look at the install script). 

## Installation

Execute this at the CLI: 

```bash
curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sez11a/VimStar/master/install-vimstar.sh | bash
```

That's all for now. Enjoy!
