Welcome to VimStar! 

This is a NeoVim/Vim (haven't tested Vim yet; I really need to get around to
that) distribution optimized for *writing*. Colors and fonts (in GUI mode) are
a homage to WordStar. 

Quick Guide: 

1.  There's a space menu. In normal mode, hit the space bar to see the
    functions. These will grow over time. 

2.  There are function key bindings (see below). 

3.  Plugins provided by VimPlug, and should be downloaded automatically after
    installing. 

4.  Configuration is symlinked, so you can try VimStar and then easily go back
    to your own configuration (have a look at the install script). 

Function Keys: 

**F3:** Toggle NERDTree. 

**F4:** In a GUI, go to Focus Mode. 

**F5:** Run Latexmk to produce a document out of your LaTeX. 

**F8:** Run MarkdownComposer to preview your Markdown files. 

**F9:** Toggle between word processor (i.e., word wrap) and Code mode. Changes
the screen background so you can always tell which mode you're in. 

That's all for now. Enjoy!
