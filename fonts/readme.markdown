# Readme

The font contained here comes from [The Oldschool PC Font
Resource](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist), and is copyrighted by
VileR, the owner of that website. He's released it under the 
[Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) 
license. Since VimStar is inspired by old school character mode word processors,
it seemed appropriate to use this font as the default font in VimStar. 

I modified this version using the excellent [Nerd
Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) tool, to add the Powerline
symbols necessary for use with the
[Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) status bar. Since the
font's license requires me to release it under the same terms, I hereby gladly
do so, with gratefulness to its original author and designers.
